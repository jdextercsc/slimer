# 3.0. Configurations
## 3.1. Configuration overview
The following list provides a high level view of the configuration defined above:
-	All client access to Horizon will be via a virtual IP that will provide access to the HA Proxy load balancers.
-	The HA Proxy service will load balance connectivity to the controller nodes that host the other OpenStack services.
-	The controller nodes will provide a centralized management system for the OpenStack deployment.
-	The Nova boot disk will be on local storage.
- A base configuration of 3 controller nodes, will provide that all openstack services are highly available.
-	MySQL databases will be clustered across at least controller nodes
-	RabbitMQ nodes running on each of the controller nodes will be clustered to provide a RabbitMQ broker service.
-	ScaleIO will be used to present underlying storage to Cinder.
-	Swift storage nodes will be used to host the glance imaging service and provide object storage functionality.

_Note: The diagram also displays the non-routed networks required for vxlan transport (applicable to tenant workload only) and the ScaleIO and Swift technologies. These technologies are defined in more detail further on in the document._
